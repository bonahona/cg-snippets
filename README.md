# CG Snippets
Small reusable pieces of code for shaders / CG programming

## Descripion
This repository serves as a collection of tiny pieces of [CG](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/cg/ "C for graphics") programming snippets for specific usages.
Most are not complete and usable as-is. The purpose is to copy the snippet and adopt it to each specific usage as needed.

Most the code is written for the CG programming language. Snippets in [HLSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl, "HLSL Guide")/[GSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language "GSL Guide") will say so explicitly.
All CG code should be usable is HLSL as HLSL is a superset of CG.
