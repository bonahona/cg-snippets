## Descripion

Non are complete and usable as-is. The purpose is to copy the snippet and adopt it to each specific usage as needed.

Most the code is written for the CG programming language. Snippets in HLSL/GSL with say so explicitly.
All CG code should be usable is HLSL as HLSL is a superset of CG.
